# 🚀 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to the **DSA Repository**! This project contains well-structured implementations of various **data structures and algorithms** in *[your programming language]*. Whether you're preparing for **coding interviews**, sharpening your **problem-solving skills**, or simply exploring **DSA concepts**, this repository is for you! 🎯

## 🛠 Getting Started
### Clone the repository and set up your workspace:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tech-By-Ayushi/dsa-repo.git
cd dsa-repo
```
### Run the code:
```sh
[command to run the code, e.g., python main.py]
```

## 📂 Implemented Data Structures & Algorithms
Navigate through the folders to explore different implementations:
✅ **Data Structures:**
- 📌 Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- 🌳 Trees (BST, AVL, etc.), Graphs, Hash Tables, Heaps

✅ **Algorithms:**
- 🔀 Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- 🔍 Searching (Binary Search, DFS, BFS, etc.)
- 🏆 Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms
